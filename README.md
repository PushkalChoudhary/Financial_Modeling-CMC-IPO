# Financial Modeling & Valuation – Camera Manufacturing Company (CMC)

## 📝 Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive **financial modeling and valuation (FMV)** case study for the **Camera Manufacturing Company (CMC)**, a sports camera company that recently filed for an IPO.  

The objective of this project was to build a complete integrated **3-statement financial model**, perform a **discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation**, and conduct a detailed analysis to determine the company’s **per-share equity value**.

##  Objectives
The financial model was built to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Identify Key Drivers** – revenue and cost drivers for CMC’s operations.  
2. **Financial Projections** – prepare integrated and projected **P&L, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow statements** for 5 years.  
3. **DCF Valuation** – estimate the intrinsic **per-share equity value** of CMC.  
4. **Scenario Analysis** – test robustness of the valuation with **Base, Best, and Worst cases**.  
5. **Valuation Summary** – highlight findings in a **valuation dashboard**.

##  Model Structure
The Excel model is an integrated workbook composed of interconnected sheets:

- **Assumptions** – key input variables: growth rates, costs, tax rates, WACC, terminal growth.  
- **P&L (Profit & Loss)** – detailed revenues, expenses, and net profit.  
- **BS (Balance Sheet)** – assets, liabilities, and equity, ensuring proper balancing.  
- **CF (Cash Flow)** – reconciles P&L and BS with operating, investing, and financing flows.  
- **Asset Schedule** – capex and depreciation schedule.  
- **Debt Schedule** – new debt, repayments, and interest expense.  
- **Equity Schedule** – changes in paid-up capital and retained earnings.  
- **Valuation** – DCF model with FCFF, Terminal Value, and per-share equity value.  
- **Relative Valuation** – trading comps & precedent transactions for cross-check.
